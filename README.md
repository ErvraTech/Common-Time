# Common-Time

Common-Time is an analysis tool designed to extract a **robust common temporal signal**
from multiple time series and to isolate **local anomalies** in distributed systems.

The project focuses on **slow drift detection** in critical multi-source environments
such as ground stations and distributed infrastructures.

---

## What problem does it solve?

When several systems drift simultaneously, standard monitoring tools
cannot easily distinguish:
- a **global drift** (infrastructure, reference clock, network)
- from **local faults** (single station or sensor failure)

This leads to false alarms, delayed diagnostics, and incorrect corrective actions.

---

## What Common-Time does

Common-Time:
- ingests multiple heterogeneous time series
- extracts a **shared slow signal** common to all sources
- separates global behavior from station-specific residuals
- highlights anomalous sources automatically

---

## Demonstration outputs

The following outputs are generated automatically from a single command
on a synthetic multi-station dataset.

![Extracted common signal](assets/common_signal.png)

*Extracted slow common drift shared by all stations.*

![Residual RMS](assets/residual_rms.png)

*Residual energy per station. The faulty station is clearly isolated.*

![Console demo](assets/console_demo.png)

*One-command execution of the Common-Time demo.*
